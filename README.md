# Analysis of the Election Audit

## Overview of Election Audit

Working from this election_results.csv file, we will use 'for' loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results.

Additional data was requested by the election commision to complete the audit:
* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* The county with the highest turnout

We'll then, print the results to the command line and save them to election_results.txt file.
